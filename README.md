This project is a copy of standart BigInteger class with serious improvements in multiplication algorithm.

The goal of the project is to provide more efficient big numbers multiplication algorithm instead of so called "school algorithm" in original implementation.

Here you can find:

* Karatsuba multiplication
* Toom-Cook 3-way multiplication
* Multiplication that uses Fast Hartley Transform
* Description of work and short presentation of results on Russian can be found in downloads section or here:

Note: original BigInteger class was truncutted to get rid of some unimportant to multiplication dependencies.
