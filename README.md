This project is a copy of standart BigInteger class with serious improvements in multiplication algorithm.

The goal of the project is to provide more efficient big numbers multiplication algorithm instead of so called "school algorithm" in original implementation.

Here you can find:

* Karatsuba multiplication
* Toom-Cook 3-way multiplication
* Multiplication that uses Fast Hartley Transform

Here you may find performance comparison slides and my diploma. Language: Russian.

Note: original BigInteger class was truncutted to get rid of some unimportant to multiplication dependencies.
